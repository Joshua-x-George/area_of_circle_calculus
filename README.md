IGNORE THIS REPO it's not for you

Basically this just adds the area under the graph of function by a tiny change 'dX'.

The circleArea.py is just the first step to integration.py. both results in the same output,
btw in integration.py the parameter 'function' needs a expression in terms of python std expression, ie x^2 can't be done but x**2 is possible
